Developing
----------

Requirements:
* Git
* Ruby (v2.0.0+)
* Bundler
  (included from within Rails (`gem install rails`) or `gem install bundler`)
* Jekyll <http://jekyllrb.com/>
  (install from within Ruby: `gem install jekyll`)

Clone it. (`git clone https://github.com/resir014/resir014.xyz.git`)

Then install all the bundled plugins.

```bash
$ bundle install
```

After the plugins are installed, we can now run a local server from within our computer.

```bash
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```
