#### Build Your Next Website with React, GatsbyJS, and Netlify

My very first public speaking appearance, a talk I did during the #36 JakartaJS meetup. Here I talk about GatsbyJS, which powers the very website you're on right now, as well as some really cool stuff that you can do with it.

This talk is brought to you by the letters "u", and "h".
