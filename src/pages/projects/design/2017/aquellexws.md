**[Aquellex](https://aquellex.ws)** is an Australian chiptune musician. I was tasked to assist him in implementing an existing HTML/CSS design on an easy-to-use static-site generation system. This was also a chance for me to try out [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), which is a really sleek static-site generator powered by React.

This was a fun project overall, since I got the chance to play around with modern web technologies and implement it on a retro-themed website. If chiptune music is your thing, go check out his music!
