I started getting into web development when I self-learned HTML and CSS back in high school. I currently work as a junior web developer for [C88 Financial Technologies](https://www.c88fin.com/), a well-known player in the Indonesian fintech industry.

I love open-source software, and I have been extensively contributing to the community for years. One of the biggest contributions I've made was to support the Indonesian localisation effort for the [Brackets editor](http://brackets.io/). On top of that, I also have many other utilities and personal projects that I host on my GitHub profile.

My other interests include, video games, motorsports, photography, and music. I keep a catalogue of interests on my [tilde.town page](https://tilde.town/~resir014/). Be sure to check them out, we might have some things in common!

## Email

Due to the increasing amount of spam that I get nowadays, you will have to solve this simple puzzle to get my email address:
