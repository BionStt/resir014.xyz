I started getting into web development when I self-learned HTML and CSS back in high school. I currently work as a junior web developer for <a href="https://www.c88fin.com/" target="_blank">C88 Financial Technologies</a>, a well-known player in the Indonesian fintech industry.

I love open-source software, and I have been extensively contributing to the community for years. One of the biggest contributions I've made was to support the Indonesian localisation effort for the <a href="http://brackets.io/" target="_blank">Brackets editor</a>. On top of that, I also have many other utilities and personal projects that I host on my GitHub profile.

My other interests include, video games, motorsports, photography, and music. I keep a catalogue of interests on my <a href="https://tilde.town/~resir014/" target="_blank">tilde.town page</a>. Be sure to check them out, we might have some things in common!

## Stalk me.

I *might* do some freelance work over time, so if you want to get in touch with me, even if you just want to say hi, feel free to do so.

## Email

Due to the increasing email spam that I get nowadays, you will have to solve this simple puzzle in order to get my email address:

```
echo 'C6D:C_`co8>2:=]4@>' | tr '!-~' 'P-~!-O'
```

## About this website

This [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) website, hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) uses a slightly-modified version of [Roundabout](http://blvd.space/roundabout), a theme initially designed to be the base of all my websites. It's also available for everyone, so feel free to give it a try!
